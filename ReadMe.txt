This is a program to take a user specified text file and encrypt it with a chosen key. 
It first prompts the user for the path of their chosen text file and then prints out the contents of the file. It then cleans the data to remove non alphabetical characters and then converts the remaining character to uppercase.
Then the program breaks the string of data into bigrams.
The program takes these bigrams and finds their index in the encryption square and returns the encrypted character.
The characters are then put through the same encryption in reverse to return the original characters now decrypted.
